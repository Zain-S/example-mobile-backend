Example App Backend
====

This is a really simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) webapp that you can use to test Stripe's [example iOS apps](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) and
[example Android apps](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android).

This is intended for example purposes only: you'll likely need something more serious for your production apps.

To deploy this free on Glitch, visit https://glitch.com/edit/#!/stripe-example-mobile-backend and click "Remix".

Happy testing!
